# BUREKTech 2.0

BUREKTech, BT for short, is a work-in-progress fork of RBDoom3, that will bring to the table some nice little things for people like me - who aren't happy with popular modern engines - but wanna make games nevertheless.

## A little bit of history 

[BUREKTech 1](https://github.com/Admer456/ioq3-burek) started off as a fork of ioquake3, which I used to make a game demo for a local gamedev competition in 2021. Then I realised, hold on a second, I wanna implement features which are already in idTech 4, for example a GUI system like in idTech 4.  

Thus, BUREKTech 2 was born. The first feature it got was a separate weapon FOV.  

## Plans

Some notable planned changes include:
* vegetation
* dynamic music
* full TrenchBroom support, assuming a TrenchBroom fork that supports MD5 models etc.
* a smoother workflow for animated models
* new entities for mappers
* native AI and weapons, as opposed to DoomScript
* RmlUI, an HTML/CSS-based UI solution to replace Flash/SWF

Read [the plans](PLANS.md) for some more details.
